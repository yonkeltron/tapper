= tapper: Emitting TAP from the command line 

If you're anything like me, you love http://testanything.org/[TAP] and wish that more things supported it. If this is the case, then `tapper` is for you.

This tool allows you to emit TAP streams from things like shell scripts. For example, the following Bash script:

[bash]
....
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

tapper plan --from 1 --to 2
tapper test pass --number 1 --message "This is a passing test."
tapper test fail --number 2 --message "This is a failing test."
....

The above would produce a TAP stream with a proper plan line followed by two tests, one passing and one failing.

== Installation

Go ahead and install it with `cargo install tapper`.

You can upgrade it with `cargo install tapper --force`.
